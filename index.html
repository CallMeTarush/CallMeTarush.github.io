            Hi! Now Usually people (like me) have some <i>fancy template</i> with all their work and accomplishments listed out here, but 
            I don't really feel like being part of this crazy system of being part of the wheel and waiting for some recruiter or 
            talent acquistion manager to look me up and see my work and <i>"hire me"</i>. I'm 20, I have 5 offers (4 startups and 1 MNC) to
            start working in tech for them (Casual Flex). <br><br>
            
            Now, Don't get me wrong, I love working, I love my field, I love making new things everyday.
            But what I've learned is that as long as it's something new and interesting it's insanely fun but as long as it starts getting
            <i>weighed</i> down by these corporate standards, reviews, SCRUM meetings, ARB reviews, just basically a lot of meetings for just pushing
            your work into the world (This applies mostly to bigger companies but at the end of the day that's what a startup wants to become) 
            the entire flow gets super slow and at the end of the day plain boring. I know these meetings are important for organizations,
            but at a personal level I just don't believe that this is the only way to go  about them. <br><br>
            
            <div id="bored">If you're bored, <span id="play2" onclick="playRandomSound(120)" > Generate a random Beat </span> <br><br></div>
    

            What I've realised is that I want to
            <i>be my own person</i>, do my own work and maybe one day have my own team of people who all have that creative spark and that rush 
            whenever we want to implement something new, build something new come up with an idea. I am tired of being part of a society 
            where your validity comes from how much you earn and where you stuided and what degree's you have. Let's start putting back value where
            it belongs, in the person.
